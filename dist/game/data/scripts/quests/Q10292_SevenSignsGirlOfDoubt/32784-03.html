Alright. Then how about proving yourself by slaying the monsters around here, without venturing too far? The <font color="LEVEL">Farm Bandits and Beast Devourers</font> lurking around the Beast Farm have been marked using my magic. Slay them, and they will give up these marks. Your test is to collect 10 of these marks.<br>
Don't look so glum. Maybe it's harder than you think, but either way I have to know who I'm dealing with.
